## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to set up and run iNetpulse locally:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **Git** (for cloning the repository)
* **Administrator/Root privileges** might be required for packet capture.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/piyush2004parate/INetpulse.git](https://github.com/piyush2004parate/INetpulse.git)
cd INetpulse
```
*(Replace `piyush2004parate` with your actual GitHub username if different, and `INetpulse` with your repository name if it differs.)*

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment

* **For Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
* **For Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Apply Database Migrations (if applicable)

If your Django project uses a database, apply migrations to set it up:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6️⃣ Run the Django Server

Start the local development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
*(Note: You might need to run this command with `sudo` on Linux/macOS or "Run as Administrator" on Windows if you encounter permissions errors related to network interfaces for packet capture.)*

### 7️⃣ Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## 📂 Project Structure

A typical Django project structure for iNetpulse would look like this:

```
iNetpulse/
├── iNetpulse/                # Django project settings
│   ├── settings.py           # Core project settings
│   ├── urls.py               # Main URL configurations
│   └── wsgi.py               # WSGI entry-point for deployments
├── <your_app_name>/          # Main application for network analysis (e.g., 'analyzer', 'network_app')
│   ├── migrations/           # Database schema migrations
│   ├── templates/            # HTML templates for the web interface
│   ├── static/               # Frontend assets like CSS, JavaScript, images
│   ├── views.py              # Django views handling web requests and logic
│   ├── models.py             # Database models for data storage
│   ├── admin.py              # Django admin configurations
│   └── urls.py               # App-specific URL configurations
├── data/                     # Folder for CSV data storage (e.g., raw packet logs, analysis results)
├── venv/                     # Python virtual environment (created during setup)
├── manage.py                 # Django's command-line utility
├── requirements.txt          # List of Python dependencies
└── README.md                 # This README file
```

*(Note: `<your_app_name>` would be the actual name of your Django application within the project, e.g., `network_monitor` or `analysis_app`)*

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

* **Visualization Issues:** Ensure Matplotlib and its dependencies are properly installed. If charts don't render, check your browser's console for JavaScript errors.
* **Packet Capture Errors:** Running the Django server with `python manage.py runserver` might not have sufficient privileges to access network interfaces. Try running your terminal/IDE as administrator (Windows) or using `sudo python manage.py runserver` (Linux/macOS). Be cautious when using `sudo`.
* **Database Errors:** If you encounter issues with data persistence or integrity, try clearing or recreating CSV files in the `/data` folder, or running `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate` if you made changes to models.
* **"Port already in use" error:** If you see an error like `Address already in use`, it means another process is using port `8000`. You can either kill that process or run Django on a different port: `python manage.py runserver 8001`.

## 🧭 Future Enhancements

* Integration of AI-driven predictive analytics for proactive threat prevention.
* Advanced alert customization for network anomalies (e.g., email, SMS notifications).
* Improved dashboards with more interactive and dynamic visualizations (e.g., using D3.js or other charting libraries).
* Integration with third-party security tools and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
* Cloud-based monitoring support for distributed environments.

## 🏁 Conclusion

iNetpulse bridges the gap between network performance analysis and cyber threat detection, providing a single, intuitive platform for both. Its modular design, real-time analytics, and visualization capabilities make it a scalable solution for organizations of all sizes.
